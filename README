Question 1.1
Just iterating over the values loses the key information.  If by looping to visit the values in order meant iterating over the entries, then the entries are in a set, which is un-ordered and thus can't be sorted.

Question 2.1
"The," "I," "of," "to," and "a" occur most frequently.

Question 2.2
In the melville.txt file, the words "his" and "he" occur most frequently.  This is because the main characters in the story are male.  The other file, poe.txt, a word occurring most frequently is "my."  This is because the story is told from the perspective of the narrator.

Question 2.3
The keys are alphabetized for words that have the same frequency.  This is because the TreeMap keys are maintained in a sorted order.

Question 3.1
new LargeWordPred(12) is a constructor call that produces an instance of a predicate.  The printSatisfying function expects an instance of type predicate, so this is sufficient.
